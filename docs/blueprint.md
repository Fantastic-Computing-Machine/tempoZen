## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sage green (#8BAC9D) to create a calming, organized and fresh ambiance. Use Flutter with Material You to apply dynamic color theming based on the user's wallpaper.
- Background color: Off-white (#F4F3F1), providing a soft, unobtrusive backdrop that supports focus.
- Accent color: Dusty rose (#C4A4A4) to accent key interactions with subtle contrast
- Font pairing: 'Belleza' (sans-serif) for headings, and 'Alegreya' (serif) for body text to create a blend of modern aesthetics and classic readability. Implement custom text styles using Flutter's `TextStyle` and apply them consistently throughout the app.
- Use clear, minimalist icons with a thin stroke width to match the modern style. Ensure consistency in style across all icons. Utilize Flutter's built-in icon library or custom SVG icons for scalability and sharpness.
- Use a grid-based layout for consistent spacing and alignment. Prioritize a clean and uncluttered interface to enhance usability. Leverage Flutter's `GridView` and `Flex` widgets for responsive and adaptable layouts.
- Incorporate subtle animations for interactions (e.g., adding a new event, marking a task as complete) to provide feedback without being distracting. Employ Flutter's `AnimatedContainer` and `Hero` widgets for smooth and engaging transitions.
